Trust me on this, once you hear her story, you’ll understand why she’s one of Korea’s most beloved, albeit tragic, heroines, embodying an unyielding spirit that has shaped the very fabric of our collective consciousness. Growing up, stories like Bari’s were more than just bedtime tales; they were lessons in resilience, devotion, and the profound concept of &amp;lsquo;han&amp;rsquo; (한), a deep-seated grief that eventually fuels an incredible will to overcome.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
